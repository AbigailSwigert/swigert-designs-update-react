				<p>Hey there! I'm</p>
				<h1 className="gradient-text">Abigail Swigert,</h1>
				<p>
					an award-winning multidisciplinary graphic designer based in Carrollton, Texas. I graduated from the
					University of North Texas with a B.A in Design Management, and I have over 5 years of experience working with
					individuals and organizations of all sizes to craft engaging print and digital marketing collateral.
					<br />
					<br />
					When I'm not honing my design skills, I enjoy getting lost in fantasy and science fiction stories, and
					examining the themes and deeper meanings of my favorite games, movies, and TV shows. You can find me
					supporting and hosting events for DFW Creatives and Bold Idea.
